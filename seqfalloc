Algorithm for Sequential File Allocation:
Step 1: Start the program.
Step 2: Get the number of memory partition and their sizes.
Step 3: Get the number of processes and values of block size for each process.
Step 4: First fit algorithm searches all the entire memory block until a hole which is big enough is encountered. It allocates that memory block for the requesting process.
Step 5: Best-fit algorithm searches the memory blocks for the smallest hole which can be allocated to requesting process and allocates it.
Step 6: Worst fit algorithm searches the memory blocks for the largest hole and allocates it to the process.
Step 7: Analyses all the three memory management techniques and display the best algorithm which utilizes the memory resources effectively and efficiently.
Step 8: Stop the program.


code:
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
void main()
{
int f[50], i, st, len, j, c, k, count = 0;
for(i=0;i<50;i++)
f[i]=0;
printf("Files Allocated are : \n");
x: count=0;
printf("Enter starting block and length of files:");
scanf("%d%d", &st,&len);
for(k=st;k<(st+len);k++)
if(f[k]==0)
count++;
if(len==count)
{
for(j=st;j<(st+len);j++)
if(f[j]==0)
{
f[j]=1;
printf("%d\t%d\n",j,f[j]);
}
if(j!=(st+len-1))
printf("The file is allocated to disk\n");
}
else
printf("The file is not allocated \n");
printf("Do you want to enter more file(Yes - 1/No - 0)");
scanf("%d", &c);
if(c==1)
goto x;
